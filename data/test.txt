If I had five minutes left on earth I would call my family and tell them I love then and  open up a bottle of wine and hug my boyfriend
I think I would sit in a comfortable place and watch everybody else run around
I would say that I think that I did ok in life and that I'm very grateful that I have such a good family and my parents are such good people and I'm really grateful
Definitely not pray, what else maybe, like I don't know, as many drugs I can find in five minutes, I would grab my best friends and cry
I would go home and hang out with my boyfriend If I could get there in five minutes
I'm trying to think about how much traffic there would be that would be dependent on whether or not I could construct a kite big enough for me to like attach to the back of a car and then take a kite through the streets of manhattan like on a giant glider you know like instead of being pulled like one of those big glider things behind a boat you get pulled by like a car down the streets of manhattan and see how high I could get and hopefully I wouldn't smash into a building but parasiling I'd go parasailing behind a car down Park Avenue depending on traffic 
Probably run outside sun call family tell them I love them and buy a rhesus peanut butter cup and enjoy that while the world goes to shits
Maybe like trying to find a place to hide which is stupid cuz you're going to blow up anyway. Maybe nothing sit back and take a look wait for it
I'm gonna hug anyone that I see on the street and you did I see you want us to the first time and say I love you
Yes they say that when you're drowning your life flashes before your eyes so I wonder if I knew I was gonna diethe flash before my eyes and affected I guess I'll just watch that happen I would enjoy it
Basically do anything that's supposed to be really bad for me, I'd do a lot of it as much as humanly possible
I think i would make phonecall to my parents and say i appreciate because actually i have never say I love you appreciate during the twenty years
I want to be in a place where I can sit and there's a whale in front of me and I can play and enjoy this peaceful moment
